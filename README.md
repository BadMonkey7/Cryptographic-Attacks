# RSA-Attacks

Repository containing my Sage and/or implementation of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem.  

1. Generalized Hastad's broadcast attack (Sage) 
2. Common modulus attack (Sage/Python)
3. Partial Key Recovery Attack (Unfinished) (Sage)
4. Wiener's Attack for Small Public Exponent (Sage)
5. Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack (Sage)

Note:

Sage is regarded as being very difficult to install on Windows, since users need to download both VirtualBox and the Sage virtual machine in order to use its features.  Luckily, it does have a presence in the cloud.

# Future Works

1. Finish implementing Partial Key Recovery and Coppersmith's method for finding small roots of multivariate polynomial definied over a ring
2. Add Coppersmith's Short Pad Attack as an extension to Franklin-Reiter 
3. Add Python implementations of existing programs

Feel free to let me know if there are any bugs.
